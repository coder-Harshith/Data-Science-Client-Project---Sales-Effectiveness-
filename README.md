# Data Science Client Project - Sales Effectiveness:

## üîç Sales Lead Categorization using Machine Learning

### üß© Project Overview

This project, conducted as part of the DataMites‚Ñ¢ Data Science mentoring program, focuses on enhancing **sales effectiveness** through intelligent lead categorization. The client, **FicZon Inc.**, a provider of both on-premise and SaaS IT solutions, has been facing a decline in sales performance due to reliance on manual lead classification methods. The objective is to leverage **machine learning** to automate lead categorization, thereby boosting conversion rates and improving overall sales efficiency.

### üéØ Objectives

* Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key insights related to sales effectiveness.
* Build a **predictive ML model** to classify sales leads into:

  * **High Potential**
  * **Low Potential**

### üìä Dataset Description

The dataset contains **7,422 records** and includes the following fields:

* `Created`: Timestamp of lead creation
* `Product_ID`: Identifier for the product
* `Source`: Origin of the lead (e.g., web, referral)
* `Mobile`: Contact number
* `EMAIL`: Email address
* `Sales_Agent`: Assigned sales personnel
* `Location`: Geographical data
* `Delivery_Mode`: Mode of product delivery
* `Status`: Manually labeled lead category (target variable)

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
* MySQL for data storage
* Jupyter Notebook for analysis and modeling

### üí° Business Value

By predicting lead quality in advance, the model helps prioritize high-value leads and reduces the time and cost associated with manual categorization. This data-driven approach aims to **improve conversion rates and drive revenue growth**.
